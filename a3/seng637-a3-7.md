# 1 Introduction

The previous assignment focused on black box testing, while this assigment is focused on white box. This means we will be looking at the source code and determining the best way to test the functionality. Several techniques will be employed such as branch and statement coverage. This will allow the group to become familiar with white box testing and learn several options for testing code going forward.

**Test Case 1: Data with null Values2D object**

- **Objective**: Error out on Values2D data
- **Input**: `data = null`, `column = 6`, `validRows = 9`.
- **Expected Result**: The method throws an exception for the null `data` object.

| Test Case               | Execution Path | DU Pairs | Coverage |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Check for null Values2D |                |          | 64.7%    |

**Test Case 2: Data with an empty array of validRows**

- **Objective**: To cover the scenario where the loop does not iterate even once.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix`, `column = 6`, `validRows = empty array`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns `0.0`.

| Test Case               | Execution Path | DU Pairs | Coverage |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Check for null Values2D |                |          | 100%     |

**Test Case 3: Data with validRows containing indices higher than rowCount**

- **Objective**: To the case where the theres is more valid rows than matrix.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix`, `column = 6`, `validRows > data.getRowCount()`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns `0.0` because the condition `row < rowCount` is false.

| Test Case               | Execution Path | DU Pairs | Coverage |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Check for null Values2D |                |          | 20%      |

**Test Case 4: Data with validRows and some null values**

- **Objective**: To cover the false branch of the condition `if (n != null)`.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix will null rows`, `column = 6`, `validRows <= data.getRowCount()`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns the sum of the non-null values in the specified column for the validRows.

| Test Case               | Execution Path | DU Pairs | Coverage |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Check for null Values2D |                |          | 100%     |

**Test Case 5: Data with validRows and valid values 2D**

- **Objective**: To cover all lines.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix`, `column = 6`, `validRows <= data.getRowCount()`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns the sum of the column for the validRows.

| Test Case               | Execution Path | DU Pairs | Coverage |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Check for null Values2D |                |          | 100%     |
