# 1 Introduction

The previous assignment focused on black box testing, while this assigment is focused on white box. This means we will be looking at the source code and determining the best way to test the functionality. Several techniques will be employed such as branch and statement coverage. This will allow the group to become familiar with white box testing and learn several options for testing code going forward.
