# 1 Introduction

The previous assignment focused on black box testing, while this assigment is focused on white box. This means we will be looking at the source code and determining the best way to test the functionality. Several techniques will be employed such as branch and statement coverage. This will allow the group to become familiar with white box testing and learn several options for testing code going forward.

**Test Case 1: Data with null Values2D object**

- **Objective**: Error out on Values2D data
- **Input**: `data = null`, `column = valid column`, `validRows = { 6, 9 }`.
- **Expected Result**: The method throws an exception for the null `data` object.

| Test Case | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- |
| No Data   |                |          |

**Test Case 2: Data with an empty array of validRows**

- **Objective**: To cover the scenario where the loop does not iterate even once.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix`, `column = valid column`, `validRows = empty array`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns `0.0`.

| Test Case        | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Empty Valid Rows |                |          |

**Test Case 3: Data with validRows containing indices higher than rowCount**

- **Objective**: To the case where the theres is more valid rows than matrix.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix`, `column = 6`, `validRows > data.getRowCount()`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns `0.0` because the condition `row < rowCount` is false.

| Test Case                          | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Row outside the bounds of the Data |                |          |

**Test Case 4: Data with validRows and some null values**

- **Objective**: To cover the false branch of the condition `if (n != null)`.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix will null rows`, `column = 6`, `validRows <= data.getRowCount()`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns the sum of the non-null values in the specified column for the validRows.

| Test Case             | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Data with null values |                |          |

**Test Case 5: Data with validRows and valid values 2D**

- **Objective**: To cover all lines.
- **Input**: `data = positive 2D matrix`, `column = 6`, `validRows <= data.getRowCount()`.
- **Expected Result**: The method returns the sum of the column for the validRows.

| Test Case               | Execution Path | DU Pairs |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| Check for null Values2D |                |          |

With these 5 cases, they cover `100%` of the method.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Writing the unit tests was proceeded by first opening up each class and examining the behavior of the class. After opening the class test cases where written by first looking at the methods. Methods were accessed to ensure all branch cases were as well tested.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

### Test Case 1 Range Equals Method

The Range equals method has three main checks that can be seen below. The equals method is called on an object of type range and is then passed in another object. The first check ensures
that the passed in object is indeed a range object if it it not then method then returns a false. The next two checks are ensuring that both the lower and the upper values of the range are equal. This is done by using the this.upper and this.lower against the passed in objects upper and lower. When all three checks are done and no evaluations are true the statement then returns true.

```
public boolean contains(double value) {
    if (value < this.lower) {
        return false;
    }
    if (value  > this.upper) {
        return false;
    }
    return (value >= this.lower && value <= this.upper);
}
```

The following four test were written in order to test this method. The first test written declares to objects one being of type range and the next being of type "Double". The equals method was then called this would then hit the first check failing the method. The next two cases are very similar with one having dissimilar lower values then the next having dissimilar upper values. one test declares two range objects of with the same upper value. The final test has two range values with equal upper and lower values which hit the last case of returning true.

```
@Test
public void testEqualsOfDifObjects() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-5, 5);
	Double d1 = 3.0;
	d1.equals(objRange);
	objRange.equals(d1);
	assertEquals("Check to see if range object is the same Double object should be false", false, objRange.equals(d1));
}
@Test
public void testEqualsOfSameObjects() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-5, 5);
	Range objRange2 = new Range(-4, 5);
	objRange.equals(objRange2);
   	assertEquals("Check to see if two lower bound values are the same should be false", false, objRange.equals(objRange2));
}
@Test
public void testEqualsOfSameObjectsLowerMatching() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-4, 5);
	Range objRange2 = new Range(-4, 4);
	objRange.equals(objRange2);
	assertEquals("Check to see if two lower bound values are the same should be false", false, objRange.equals(objRange2));
}
@Test
public void testEqualsOfSameObjectsSameValues() {
	Range objRange = new Range(-4, 4);
	Range objRange2 = new Range(-4, 4);
	objRange.equals(objRange2);

	assertEquals("Check to see if two lower bound values are the same should be false", true, objRange.equals(objRange2));
}
```

### Test Case 2 Range Constrain Method

The Range Constrain method has three main checks that can be seen in the code snippet below. The method first calls the contains method to check the given value is within the specified range object. If the value is contained inside the range it then moves to the return statement at the bottom of the method. If this test fails then the next two checks can begin where the value is compared against the lower and upper value of the range. If value is above the upper than the upper value is returned. If the value is below the lower than the lower value is returned.

```
public double constrain(double value) {
    double result = value;
    if (!contains(value)) {
        if (value > this.upper) {
            result = this.upper;
        }
        else if (value < this.lower) {
            result = this.lower;
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

The following three tests were written in order to test the three checks where the value was either above or below or inside the range. The test either expect to see the constrained upper or lower value of the range seen in the first two test cases. While the last test case expects to see the given value returned as it fail inside the Range objects constraints.

```
 @Test
public void testAboveConstrain() { //Any value above 1 should be constrained to 1
    assertEquals("A value above the range should be constrained to 1", 1, exampleRange.constrain(2), 0.000000001d);
}

@Test
public void testBelowConstrain() { //Any value below -1 should be constrained to -1
    assertEquals("A value below the range should be constrained to -1", -1, exampleRange.constrain(-2), 0.000000001d);
}

@Test
public void testInsideConstrain() { //Checking nominal value inside the boundary range
    assertEquals("A value inside the range should give itself", 0, exampleRange.constrain(0), 0.000000001d);
}
```

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

The tool used for code coverage was EclEmma as recommended. This tool was helpful in highlighting the lines of code that were run, and how many branches were tested at each decision point.

EclEmma Pros:
-Works cleanly and clearly with Eclipse, and does not take much time to set up
-Highlights the statements that have been run
-Provides a clear report of the results

EclEmma Cons:
-Only shows the number of branches tested at a decisoin point, not which ones were tested
-Condition coverage percentage is not included in report

Statement Coverage Pros:
-By providing the percentage of statements you can determine how much of the code was run
-Simple metric that is easy to convey

Statement Coverage Cons:
-Some code might be unreachable, deflating the score
-Testing every line might be unnecessary

Branch Coverage Pros:
-Covers all the possible decision paths
-Less time consuming as other metrics

Branch Coverage Cons:
-Not every line is tested (could have errors elsewhere)
-Some testing might be redundant

Method Coverage Pros:
-Shows if any methods were missed
-Easier to hit 100%

Method Coverage Cons:
-Could miss errors in methods even if they are tested

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Requirements-Based Advantages:
-Focuses on the purpose rather than the execution
-Don't need to be as familiar with the source code
-Usually require fewer tests
-More similar to how a user would find errors

Requirements-Based Disadvantages:
-Don't see what is happening in the code
-Could miss errors that would be seen in a code review
-Don't know if every scenario is tested for

Coverage-Based Advantages:
-Focuses on execution rather than purpose
-Programming errors are more easy to catch
-Every line and branch can be tested

Coverage-Based Disadvantages:
-More knowledge of coding required
-Often more time required
-Required metrics might be difficult to hit depending on code

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

The assignment was split between the group members so that everyone was able to get experience with the tools. Some members focused on the hand calculations, while others focused on the code, but all members did some of each. This allowed for all to become familiar with the white box testing techniques.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab

There were some issues with getting the sufficient code coverage required of 'Range'. This was mostly due to the checks in place to ensure the upper value was above the lower value. Since the creation of the Range object required this to be true, the inside of the check was never entered.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

It was interesting to implement the white box testing. If some of the checks in Range were removed so that the code coverage could be incresed to the required amounts, that would reduce some confusion.
