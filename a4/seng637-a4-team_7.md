# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
The following mutants were found in the Range Class:

1. Incremented (a++) double local variable number 1 -> KILLED (Line 90: if (lower>upper){)

   This mutation was killed since the line it is checking is the check for the constructor of Range. This is called whenever a new Range is created by the test class. Therefore when it mutates the value at the check, it results in an error being thrown, and the mutation is caught.
2. Decremented (a--) double local variable number 1 -> SURVIVED (Line 91: String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower)

   This mutation was not caught by the testing, as it is within the creation of the error message of the mutation above. This line is only accessed during the throwing of an error, and does not change behaviour when this mutation happens.
3. Negated double field upper -> KILLED (Line 123: return this.upper - this.lower;)

   This mutation was caught since changing the return will lead to a mismatch between the expected and result of the test. This return was for getLength(), which was covered in the "testGetLengthPositiveRange()" method.
4. Substituted 1 with -1 -> SURVIVED (Line 158: return (b1 > this.lower);)

   This line was mutated 34 times through the testing, and there was survival for 13 of those. Since this is a comparison, if the value for this.lower is less than -1, the value for b1 could be anything above -1 and still return the same answer. So this mutation is only caught when the mutation changes the outcome of the comparison, not necessarily just the values.
5. Negated conditional -> KILLED (Line 217: if (range1 == null) {)

   This line determines which return statement will be executed, so all four mutations on this line were killed. When the conditional is negated, the return of range2 is not executed, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and result of the test. This was specifically tested in "testCombine()" method.
6. Removed conditional - replaced equality check with false -> KILLED (Line 274: if (Double.isNaN(d2)){)

    Since this line is checking for NaN values, a value for d2 of NaN will not take the desired route. This will cause an issue on the later return statement, resulting in the NaN value being returned, which is not what was expected by the test. 
7. Negated integer local variable number 3 -> SURVIVED (Line 366: if (allowZeroCrossing){)

    The variable of allowZeroCrossing is a boolean, so the negation does not change the outcome of the test. This specific method is tested in "testRepeatedShifts()", and 9 of the 13 mutations on this line are killed.
8. Replaced boolean return with true for org/jfree/data/Range::equals -> KILLED (Line 434: return false;)

    This return statment is the return when checking if two ranges have the same upper bound, so if they do not, but the boolean is changed to true, then the test has an unexpected result. This was specifically tested for in the "testEqualsOfDifObjects()" method.  
9. Substituted 29 with 1 -> KILLED (Line 463: result = 29 * result + (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));)
  
    This line is the main calculation to return the hash code. By using 1 rather than 29 the calculation is off, and this is caught by the "testHashCode()" method.    
10. Removed conditional - replaced equality check with false -> KILLED (Line 220: if(range2 == null) {)
    
    This condition check determines if the range is null, and adjusts the flow through the code as required. By just setting it to false, it allows a 'null' to pass through which gives an unexpected result. This is specifically tested for in "testCombineB()" method.

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classe"

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
Mutation testing is useful for not only checking the code, but checking the testing process. 

Advantages:
- Can find new bugs/issues
- Fairly automated
- Provides a second layer of testing after unit test
Disadvantages:
- Can take a while to run
- Lots of results to analyze
  
# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
As a group we decided to perform Selenium testing on homedepot.ca using the Selenium IDE. We decided to test functionality that would be often be used by everyday users. We excluded making purchases from the test plan. 
Here is a list functions that were tested from the website:
- Login/Logout
- Adding/Removing items from cart
- Changing the preferred store
- Testing the chat functionality
- Filtering products
- Searching for products
- Switching the website language

The selenium IDE test cases can be found [here](SENG637_A4.side)

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
Assertions and checkpoints are used at specific points of the test case to ensure the functionality is working as intended.

In our test cases, each test case has at least one assert statement to ensure the functionality is implemented properly

| Test Script Name        | Assert Statement                         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Add item to cart        | Asserts the cart qty is 1                |
| Change 'My Store'       | Asserts the new store title is updated   |
| Chat Functionality      | Asserts the chatbox is loaded            |
| Login Test              | Asserts proper user is logged in         |
| Login Test Fail         | Asserts error message occurs             |
| Login/Logout Test       | Asserts logged out message occurs        |
| Product Filtering       | Asserts filter is applied                |
| Remove item from cart   | Asserts cart is empty                    |
| Search Functionality    | Asserts search term is correctly applied |
| Switch website language | Asserts language is switched             |
# how did you test each functionaity with different test data
Not all functionality required different test data.
Only the login functionality was tested with an incorrect password to test the login test failure. 

Other functionality such as product filtering and adding/removing items to the cart cannot be tested with different data.
# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
The team members looked at both the mutation testing and the Selenium testing. This way the students could be familiar with both. The mutation testing was split between some of the members, with half doing Range and half doing DataUtilities. Then for the Selenium testing this was done independently by the students, and then pulled together into the final report.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Initially there was some difficulty in getting the mutation testing to run, but that turned out to be environment setup issues. After that the process went well. Being able to see how these different mutations affected the program was interesting, and came with some interesting outcomes.

# Comments/feedback on the assignment itself
The assignment was good, was interesting to actually work with some of these testing tools. Overall instructions were clear, but some of the analysis/discussion was a bit open ended, so we were not quite sure the best way to answer the questions.
