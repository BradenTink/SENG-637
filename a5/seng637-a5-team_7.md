# Introduction

Using failure data, we can assess the reliability of a system under test (SUT). Our group utilized the C-SFRAT reliability growth assessment tool to generate plots of the failure rate and reliability of the SUT. Reliability Demonstration Char (RDC) is a good method for checking whether the target mean time to failure (MTTF) is met. It is based on collecting failure data at various time points.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing

Testing for this assessment utilized the C-SFRAT and followed the steps outlined in the paper "A Covariate Software Tool to Guide Test Activity Allocation." Thus, the Weibull (DW2), Geometric (GM), and Second Order Negative Binomial (NB2) models were used. The comparison, using the Critic Mean, showed the best models to be the GM with covariate F (Critic score of 1.000), and the GM with covariates F and C (Critic score of 0.981).
